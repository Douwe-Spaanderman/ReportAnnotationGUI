# Medical Report Annotation Tool

A lightweight, PyQt5-based GUI for annotating medical reports using structured tasks defined in a YAML file.

## üöÄ Features

- Load patient reports from a CSV file  
- Define annotation tasks via a YAML configuration  
- Save validated annotations to JSON  

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyqt5 pyyaml
```

### 2. Launch the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Upon launching, a file selection dialog will prompt you to select:

- The patient reports CSV file  
- The annotation task YAML file  
- The output path for the annotated JSON file  

### Optional: Provide Paths via CLI

You can skip the file dialog by passing paths directly:

```bash
python app.py --csv reports.csv --yaml task.yaml --output annotations.json
```

**Arguments:**

- `--csv`: Path to the CSV file with medical reports  
- `--yaml`: Path to the YAML file defining the annotation task  
- `--output`: Path to save the output JSON file

## üìÅ File Formats

### CSV Input

The CSV file should include the following columns:

```csv
Patient-ID,Report-ID,Text
P001,R001,"Patient report text..."
```

Each row corresponds to a report that will be annotated.

### YAML Task Definition

The YAML file defines the structure and controls used during annotation:

```yaml
name: "Medical Annotation"
instructions: "Mark all relevant findings based on the report content."
groups:
  - label: "Symptoms"
    controls:
      - type: slider
        label: "Severity"
        min: 1
        max: 5
        required: true
```

Controls can include sliders, checkboxes, dropdowns, and more.

### JSON Output

Annotations are saved using the following structure:

```json
{
  "R001": {
    "Patient-ID": "P001",
    "annotations": {
      "Severity": 3
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry is indexed by the report ID, and includes both metadata and annotated values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Coming Soon

- Support for more control types (e.g., autocomplete text input)  
- Multi-annotator support
- Undo/redo functionality  
- JSON mapping back to original CSV
